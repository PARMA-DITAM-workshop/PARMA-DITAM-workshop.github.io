<h2>Scope of the Workshop</a></h2>
<p>
The current trend towards many-core and heterogeneous accelerator-based
architectures requires a global rethinking of software and hardware design,
which turn out to be more than ever before strongly entangled.
</p>
<p>
The PARMA-DITAM workshop focuses on many-core architectures, parallel
programming models, design space exploration, run-time management techniques,
tools and methodologies designed to fully exploit many-core processor
architectures (possibly heterogeneous and reconfigurable) and boost their
performance, from embedded to high performance computing platforms and
cyber-physical systems.
</p>
<br/>
<p>The PARMA-DITAM workshop will have seven main topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>T1</b>: Parallel programming models, languages, and applications for many-core platforms</li>
  <li><b>T2</b>: Compiler and virtualization techniques for novel computing architectures</li>
  <li><b>T3</b>: Run-time modeling, monitoring, adaptivity, power and memory management</li>
  <li><b>T4</b>: Design of heterogeneous and reconfigurable many-core architectures</li>
  <li><b>T5</b>: Methodologies, design tools, and high-level synthesis for heterogeneous architectures</li>
  <li><b>T6</b>: Hardware/software co-design and design space exploration</li>
  <li><b>T7</b>: Case studies, success stories and applications applying T1-T6</li>
</ul>
