<h2>Scope of the Workshop</a></h2>
<p>
​​Recent advances in AI have increased pressure on classical computing architectures,
prompting researchers and engineers to explore more efficient ways to perform
computations. From HPC systems to mobile and embedded platforms, there is a growing
need to design both hardware and software with attention to energy efficiency,
privacy, security, data locality, and raw performance.
</p>
<p>
The upcoming edition of the PARMA-DITAM workshop will focus on technologies and
methodologies that address evolving computational demands while taking into account
environmental, societal, and political constraints.
</p>
<br/>
<p>This year’s main topics include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>T1</b>: Specialized digital and analog accelerators, including in-memory and near-memory processing</li>
  <li><b>T2</b>: Energy optimization in hardware and software, including approximate computing techniques</li>
  <li><b>T3</b>: Heterogeneous, parallel, distributed, and edge computing systems</li>
  <li><b>T4</b>: Compilers, tools, and frameworks supporting the use, development, and performance analysis of novel computing architectures</li>
  <li><b>T5</b>: Open-source and sovereign hardware design, including RISC-V</li>
  <li><b>T6</b>: Case studies, applications, and real-world demonstrations related to T1–T5</li>
</ul>
