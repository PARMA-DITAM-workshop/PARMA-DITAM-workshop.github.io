<h2>Scope of the Workshop</a></h2>
<p>
The current trend towards many-core and the emerging accelerator-based 
architecture requires a global rethinking of software and hardware design, 
which turn out to be more than ever before strongly entangled. 
</p>
<p>
The PARMA-DITAM workshop focuses on many-core architectures, parallel
programming models, design space exploration, tools and run-time management
techniques to exploit the features and boost the performance of such
(possibly heterogeneous, (re-)programmable and/or (re-)configurable)
many-core processor architectures from embedded to high performance
computing platforms and cyber physical systems.
</p>
<br/>
<p>The PARMA-DITAM workshop will have seven main topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>T1</b>: Parallel programming models and languages, compilers and virtualization techniques</li>
  <li><b>T2</b>: Runtime modelling, monitoring, adaptivity, and management</li>
  <li><b>T3</b>: Runtime trade-off execution, power management, and memory management</li>
  <li><b>T4</b>: Heterogeneous and reconfigurable many-core: architectures and design space exploration</li>
  <li><b>T5</b>: Methodologies, design tools, and high level synthesis for many-core architectures</li>
  <li><b>T6</b>: Parallel applications for many-core platforms</li>
  <li><b>T7</b>: Case studies, success stories and applications applying T1-T6</li>
</ul>
